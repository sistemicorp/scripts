Drivers
=======

These are typically pieces of test equipment that are used to measure, stimulate or otherwise "test"
the device under test (DUT).  Examples of test equipment could be power supplies, oscilloscopes,
JTAG programmers, etc..

`Drivers` required for a particular DUT are listed in the `config` section of scripts.  For example::

      "config": {
        // fail_fast: if true (default), testing will stop on first failed test
        "fail_fast": false,
        // list of driver code to initialize the test environment, must be specified
        // Drivers may or may not have args
        "drivers": ["public.prism.drivers.fake.hwdrv_fake",
                    ["public.prism.drivers.fake.hwdrv_fakeArgs", {"k0": 0, "k1": 1}] ]
      },



Prism will load/init each `driver` that is listed.

The python file specified *MUST* have a class called `HWDriver`.  See the `fake` example for
implementation details and documentation.

By convention, the driver filename has prefix is `hwdrv_<name>.py`.

The Drivers files are stored by convention in a separate path relative to scripts in order to isolate
them.  `Drivers` are typically common to test multiple products.


Discover Channels
-----------------

The important method of the `HWDriver` class is `discover_channels`.

`discover_channels` method returns a list of dictionaries that represent the connected hardware used in
the test system.  That list may contain one item that is shared among all the attached test jigs, or it
might be one item per test jig.

If there are multiple hardware items, the list of those items must be in the same order across the
different hardware types.  For example, if each test jig has a Teensy4 and a Segger programmer, the list
of Teensy4s and Seggers must be in the same order.  In this example, both Segger and the Teensy4s are
connected via USB, and if a prescribed USB (cabling) setup is used (one hub per test jig) then the USB
path can be used to synchronize the two lists.  This is done in the examples provided.

Per the code documentation, `discover_channels` must return a dictionary with prescribed keys.


::

    def discover_channels(self):
        """ determine the number of channels, and popultae hw drivers into shared state

        [ {"id": i,                    # ~slot number of the channel (see Note 1)
           "version": <VERSION>,       # version of the driver
           "hwdrv": <object>,          # instance of your hardware driver

           # optional
           "close": None,              # register a callback on closing the channel, or None
           "play": jig_closed_detect   # function for detecting jig closed
           "show_pass_fail": jig_led   # function for indicating pass/fail (like LED)
           "show_msg": jig_display     # function for indicating test status (like display)

           # not part of the required block
           "unique_id": <unique_id>,   # unique id of the hardware (for tracking purposes)
           ...
          }, ...
        ]

        Note:
        1) The hw driver objects are expected to have an 'slot' field, the lowest
           id is assigned to channel 0, the next highest to channel 1, etc

        :return: <#>, <list>
            where #: >0 number of channels,
                      0 does not indicate num channels, like a shared hardware driver
                     <0 error

                  list of drivers
        """



Slot Number
-----------

When implementing python code to implement tests, there is a `channel (self.chan)` number and a `slot` number.
The channel is how Prism indexes the running threads, usually from 0 to a max of 3.  The slot number
is a number used to setup configuration of the physical system.



VISA
====

VISA is a test equipment control protocol.  See `VISA <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_instrument_software_architecture>`_

An example of VISA driver based hardware is provided in the `agilent_dso_usb_1` driver example.
