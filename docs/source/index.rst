Welcome to Sistemi's Lente/Prism documentation!
===============================================

The Prism/Lente platform is a manufacturing test system that provides a framework for creating
test programs to test your product.

The platform is intended to allow you to focus on testing your product, rather than the
infrastructure to manage the data, scripts, users, roles, version control, reporting and other mundane stuff.

Prism is the production floor test runner.

Lente is the backend manager and dB.
