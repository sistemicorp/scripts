Manufacturing Execution System (MES) Integration
################################################

Manufacturing Execution Systems (MES) offer many benefits including enhanced visibility into
production, improved efficiency, cost reduction, and better inventory monitoring.

The Prism-Lente framework supports integration using industry standard protocol OPC-UA.
Information about the OPC-UA standard is available from the OPC Foundation:
