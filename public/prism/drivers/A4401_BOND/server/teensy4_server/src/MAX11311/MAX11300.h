@brief MAX11300 - PIXI, 20-Port Programmable Mixed-Signal I/O with 
12-Bit ADC, 12-Bit DAC, Analog Switches, and GPIO

The MAX11300 integrates a PIXI, 12-bit, multichannel, analog-to-digital 
converter (ADC) and a 12-bit, multichannel, buffered digital-to-analog 
converter (DAC) in a single integrated circuit (IC). This device offers 
20 mixed-signal high-voltage, bipolar ports, which are configurable as an 
ADC analog input, a DAC analog output, a general-purpose input port (GPI), 
a general-purpose output port (GPO), or an analog switch terminal. 
One internal and two external temperature sensors track junction and 
environmental temperature, respectively. Adjacent pairs of ports are 
configurable as a logic-level translator for open-drain devices or an 
analog switch.
